### Authentication 
The app uses JWT for authentication. The user can login or register using the  (/login & /register) endpoints. Logging and registering returns
a JWT token which is used to authorize the user for further requests. The token is valid for 10 hours.

To make a request to the API, the token should be included in the header as follows:

```bash
Authorization
Bearer <token>
```
Users can use the Log&Chat system without authentication.

### Chat log system
 The app has a chat and log system where users can send   announcements to all the users in the system. 
  System automatically logs the changes made in the DB with the username of the user using the JWT Token .The chat log system is implemented using web sockets. Chat system url : http://localhost:8080/
